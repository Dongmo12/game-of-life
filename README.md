# game-of-life
implement a console version of the Game of Life in Java.  The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where the state of a cell at time tt is defined by the state of its neighbors at time t−1t−1. You are required to implement a two-dimensional array representing an infinite grid. For this test, we will consider a fixed-size grid of 5x5.
